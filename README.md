# Image Builder OVA Windows

This controller builds a new Windows OVA template using the [image builder](https//sigs.k8s.io/image-builder) project.
It uses the image-builder and burrito (windows-resource-bundle) to provide the required binaries for your plain installation.
This works fully on airgap and Internet restricted environments, all it's needed is to run the controller on a TKG
cluster and the controller will figure out the configurations required to build the image, you can still specify
and overwrite any parameter.

## Getting Started

Youâ€™ll need a Tanzu Kubernetes Grid cluster to run against. This will be available as a Tanzu package on next PR.

### Running on the cluster

1. Install Instances of Custom Resources, you can install the CR from the samples folder, change any parameter from the API spec:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:
	
```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/tkw:tag
```
	
3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/tkw:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing

Run, test and open a PR or issues with a detailed procedure to replicate

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster 

### Development
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
